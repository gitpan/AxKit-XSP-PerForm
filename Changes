Revision history for Perl extension AxKit::XSP::PerForm.

1.7
    - Patch from nachoman to finally properly support single and multiple select
    - Patch from Mark Hershberger fixing:
      - If the error message contains the word "at", everything
        from that "at" to the end of the error is deleted.
      - If a load_* function is defined, then the submit_*
        functions get the value that load_* provides rather than
        what was submitted.

1.6
    - Removed action from form to allow it to work with Session taglib

1.4
    - Documentation added
    - More widgets implemented, some changed around a bit.
