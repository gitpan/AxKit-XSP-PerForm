Revision history for Perl extension AxKit::XSP::PerForm.

1.8.3
    - Added support for a default form submit routine, in case the
      form was submitted without clicking a button.

1.8.2
    - Add disabled, onclick and onchange attributes to each element

1.8.1
    - Really fix the problem with select boxes not loading contents on
      a submit.
    - Update WebUtils requirement to 1.5 in Makefile.PL

1.8
    - Change to use can() so we can use XSP inheritance
    - Added onload and onvalidate attributes to each tag (allow to specify
      external code to validate/load, or use single function for multiple
      tags)
    - Better support for multiple forms per page
    - Numerous other minor bug fixes

1.7
    - Patch from nachoman to finally properly support single and
      multiple select
    - Patch from Mark Hershberger fixing:
      - If the error message contains the word "at", everything
        from that "at" to the end of the error is deleted.
      - If a load_* function is defined, then the submit_*
        functions get the value that load_* provides rather than
        what was submitted.

1.6
    - Removed action from form to allow it to work with Session taglib

1.4
    - Documentation added
    - More widgets implemented, some changed around a bit.
